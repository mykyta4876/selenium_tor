I've a python automation task now.

Would you be willing to make an automated buying boy for a CC selling website?
Its a tor / .onion website

http://briansclcfyc5oe34hgxnn3akr4hzshy3edpwxsilvbsojp2gwxr57qd.onion/cvv/search/b98ea8b0c64147ac5bb850e08b686cb2bfeb0dfc/
If you use search link after logging in, it will automatically load the products

Everyday at 8am this website will release more stock.
That is the bins I need, they come in stock 1 time at 8am
But you can use search for bin “414720”
This will always have stock

The bot needs to be constantly refreshing the search link and detect if there is available cards to buy. 
Sometimes when site is under load, there is an error when trying to add to cart, so bot needs to detect if adding to cart is successful or not
Then need to complete order from cart, and need to detect again if there is error, or its processing successfully
can you also add the ability to make run multiple instances with different tor circuits?

you can use python chromedriver selenium.
if you're an expert, you can complete in 3 hours.
budget: $150
deadline: a day.


pip install selenium, pandas, requests, 2captcha-python
